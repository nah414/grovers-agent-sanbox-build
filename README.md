# grovers-agent-sanbox-build
Full Docker container sandbox build guide. This has been tested and works great. Shows the how to, what went wrong, and how it was fixed. 
Used Git Bash, Docker Desktop, Redis, Prometheus, and Grafana for a local sandbox with limited rule sets. 
Have fun and be responsible.
